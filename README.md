AniDroid
========

An animation library by Benedikt Gro√ü, ported to the programming environment Android by Maik Vlcek.

## What is it about?
Ani is a lightweight library for creating animations and transitions. Easily spoken Ani helps you to move things around on the screen or a bit more abstract, to animate any numeric variable.

## Notes on the port
This port of the original library differs in a few aspects:

* Removed dependency for processing.core.PApplet, meaning rewriting some parts of the code to use native methods of String, Math etc. instead of the PApplet helper methods. Furthermore some additional methods and a constant were added to the utility class AniUtil
* No support for timeMode FRAMES so far
* papplet.millis() is emulated using an millisecond offset (set in AniCore.start()) and System.getCurrentMillis() in AniCore.millis()
* removed demos and examples
* no precompiled library jar
